                <p>We are proud Africans with the intention of informing the world of who we are and what others think of us. We  will discuss the past ,
                    present and the future and a way forward on how we can better the lives of Africans in the face of the world. We might blame certain people
                     for being part of Africaâ€™s problem. In that way, we will know better where to start solving the problem since it has already been identified.
