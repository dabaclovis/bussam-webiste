              <p>"Before slavery was practised in the New World, there was no special denigration of Africans. Travellers to this continent described the
                   inhabitants in their records with natural curiosity and examination to be expected of individuals coming from different environments.
                   It was when slave trade and slavery began to develop ghastly proportions that made them the base of that capital accumulation which assisted
                   the rise of Western industrialism, that a new attitude towards Africans emerged. 'Slavery in the Caribbean has been too narrowly identified
                   with the man of colour. A racial twist has thereby been given to what is basically an economic phenomenon. Slavery was not born of racism,
                   rather racism was the consequence of slavery.' With this racial twist was invented the myth of colour inferiority. This myth supported the the
                   subsequent rape of our continent with its despoliation and continuing exploitation under the advanced forms of colonialism and imperialism.”

                    <p class=" card-text">There are over one billion people living in the continent of Africa. Africans have a wide range of cultural beliefs and ancestral worships.
                        In my own opinion, Africans are the nicest people on planet earth and the most harmless of all living beings on earth.
                        The continent has gone via a lot of torment in the past including but on limited to;slavery,colonialism, exploitation in both material
                        and human resources, brainwash and more ...</p>

                         to talking about slavery. We understand totally that the truth hurts but
                         we can’t hide from the truth and it’s part of history in which we study the past, the present and the future and  also to current the mistakes of the past.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Colonialism was a way in which the Europeans were controlling Africa directly by themselves or
                         indirectly through the use of African traditional rulers.
                        Colonialism with all its concepts was not a good idea and what makes it worse today is Africans still rely on
                         their colonial master to solve their continental problems.
